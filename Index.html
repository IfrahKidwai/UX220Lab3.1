                I’m a really big movie person, but recently I haven’t been able to watch that many due the workload of school. Despite that, I've still been able to watch a couple and by far my favourite would be the titanic. Even though I have watched it in the past before, re-watching it made me take more of the movie in an emotional aspect.

                The movie itself is a classic. Everyone I know loves it. The reason for it being my favourite is because I genuinely believe it to be a cinematic masterpiece. The movie is an emotional rollercoaster that let me feel many emotions all at once.
